Groups the books on an Amazon wishlist by publisher name and store it on a `JSON` file (`config.json`)

### Setup

Create a file on the project's root called `config.json`. Inside it, paste the following content and replace the info with your own:
```json
{
    "url": "[YOUR-AMAZON-WISHLIST-URL-HERE-WITHOUT-BRACES]"
}
```
Alternatively, execute `script.py` and paste your Amazon Wishlist URL on the terminal when prompted.
